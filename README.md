## How to run

### Create a virtual environment

First, create and activate a virtual environment, named .venv, using this command:

#### Windows

```sh
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux

```sh
virtualenv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

Note that this has only been tested on Windows, for now, using Python 3.12.6.


### Dependencies

Install the dependencies on the virtual environment from requirements.txt:

#### Windows

```sh
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Linux

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that this has only been tested on Windows, for now, using Python 3.12.6.
